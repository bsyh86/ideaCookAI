# Charles's Daily Notes - Product Management Software

## Q3 Epic: "Advanced Analytics & Inventory"

Goal: Create the most powerful, yet intuitive, analytics suite in the SMB POS market to increase retention and create a new key selling proposition.

Current Sprint: Dev team is working on the foundational data architecture. This will enable us to build features like ingredient tracking, waste analysis, and sales forecasting.

Next Steps: Draft user stories for the "Recipe Costing" feature. Review UX wireframes for the new dashboard.

## Concerns:

David from Sales is relentlessly pushing for a one-off "Custom Loyalty Program" for a single prospect. This is a massive resource drain and a classic example of letting a whale wag the dog. It doesn't align with our strategic goal of serving the broader market.

The data from BI is too raw. Toby sends spreadsheets, but I need insights. What's the adoption rate of our current features? Where are users dropping off?

Got an email from Sarah in CS. Her feedback on inventory is crucial and aligns perfectly with our roadmap. We need to reassure her that a real solution is coming, not just a quick fix like the "Out of Stock" button David mentioned. We need to manage expectations.
