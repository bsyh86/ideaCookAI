# Toby's Daily Notes - Digital Sticky Notes

Check daily performance dashboards.

The query from yesterday is still running. Need to optimize.

Look into the user activity logs. Numbers look a bit off.

Data export for someone.

Rerun the monthly revenue report. Something needs fixing.

Need to update the model.




Feedback: This is a good start, Toby! To make these notes more actionable, try adding specific details like the dashboard names, query IDs, or report titles you're referring to. Also, include what you suspect is "off" with the numbers in the user activity logs to give yourself a clearer direction when you revisit these tasks.
