David's Daily Notes - CRM & Voicemail Reminders

Objective: CLOSE The Gourmet Group deal.

Urgent Tasks:
Left 2 voicemails for their CTO. Need to confirm ETA on the Custom Loyalty Program feature. This is a non-negotiable for them. They will not sign without it.

Need Product to commit to a Q3 delivery for the Loyalty feature. Have they started development? Emailed Charles again.

The client also mentioned a simple "Out of Stock" button as a "nice to have" for their servers. Pitched it as something we can deliver quickly to build goodwill.

Concerns:
Product seems to be dragging their feet. Charles keeps talking about "scalability" and "roadmaps." We need to be agile and respond to the market's biggest fish.

Marketing is sending me generic leads when my entire focus is on this one enterprise account.

Meeting Prep: Need a slide deck showing a mock-up of The Gourmet Group's branding on our loyalty interface.
